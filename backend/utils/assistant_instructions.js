    - guilt score updates should be calculated based on the evidence and the player's responses to the interrogator, disregard if the player is the culprit or not. 
    - the round object should be updated with the deduction as to why the the guilt score is being updated to a certain value based on the evidence and the player's responses

7. Analyze voting rounds:
    - voting rounds are where all players vote on a suspect who they think is the killer

    - if the vote was incorrect, the next interrogation round should be conducted. if there is no round after the voting round, the game is finished and the culprit wins
    - voting round should have no deduction, but should have the voting results in the round object
    - After the voting round is complete, the next round should be conducted. If there is no round after the voting round, the outcome of the game should be determined accoridng to the instructions below

    - Conduct a total of n*2 rounds, where n is the number of players. so the total number of rounds is 2 times the number of players. there should never be more rounds than the number of players multiplied by 2
    - Each round is either an interrogation or a voting round
    - Interrogation Round Rules:
    - The player attribute for each round should be the player ID uuid
    - When the game state is first created, the first round should be an interrogation round for the first player. the round should be active and the status should be active
    - Each round has a status, it is either inactive, active, or completed
    - Interrogation rounds are for individual players, assign a player attribute for these rounds using their player ID uuid
    - voting round Rules:
    - voting rounds involve all players voting on a suspect who they think is the killer, make the player attribute for these rounds be "all".
    - there will be messages for each player and who they voted for
    - place those votes in the game state inside the round object
    - if there is a consensus on someone being the culprit, update the game state accordingly
    - if the vote was correct, the innocent players win the game and the game is finished
    - if the vote was incorrect, the next interrogation round should be conducted. if there is no round after the voting round, the game is finished and the culprit wins
    - Conduct the rounds in sequence, starting with the first player and alternating between interrogation and voting rounds
    - Assign a interregation round for each player

  8. Determine if the game is finished:
    - The game is finished when either all the rounds are completed or the players correctly vote for the culprit
    - If the players correctly vote for the culprit, the innocent players win the game
    - If the players do not correctly vote for the culprit by the time all the rounds are completed, the culprit wins the game
    - Update the game state with the outcome of the game only when one of these conditions is met
    - Until a winner has been determined, the game should continue with the next round and the game_state.status should be set to active


    IMPORTANT NOTE:
    NEVER ADD MORE ROUNDS TO THE GAME THAN THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS MULTIPLIED BY 2. THIS WILL CAUSE THE GAME TO BE INCOMPLETE AND THE GAME STATE TO BE INACCURATE.

Remember to be impartial but thorough in your investigation.`;
